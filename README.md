# In this project, I used some basic text mining techniques such as word cloud, sentiment analysis, word correlations to explore students' reflective journals after participating in some activiites. 
The journals were submitted in the format of pdf and they were firstly extrated to text via the "pdftools" package of R, and saved them to a xlsx. file.
